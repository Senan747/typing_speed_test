    "Information protection: one of the most necessary aspects is to minimize the amount of information to which your opponent can access.It is protecting the information you have from capture by the other side.The opponent can attack to our data with two ways which we protect everytime.First,phsyically technologies such as data storage facilities, computers, and transport mechanisms.Second one,in my opinion,more important-technologies that prevent bits from being seen and intercepted by the the enemy. This certainly includes basic computer security technologies such as passwords,then,compound encyrption adn etc.",
    "Information manipulation: information manipulation in the context of information warfare is the alteration of information with intent to change the opponent's picture of reality. Opponent can do it with using a number of technologies, including computer software for editing text, graphics, video, audio, and other information transport forms.",
    "If I need to give an example about IW,I may say Russo-Ukrainian wars.The whole world  knows that the Russo-Ukrainian Warhas been ongoing between Russia (along side Russian separatists in Ukraine) and Ukraine since February 2014. Fighting for the first eight years of the conflict also included naval incidents, cyberwarfare, and heightened political tensions. In February 2022, the conflict saw a major escalation as Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.And during the 2022 Russo-Ukranian war. Ukrainian forces have taken advantage of deficiencies in Russian communications by allowing them to piggyback on Ukrainian networks and communicate. Ukrainian forces then eavesdrop, and cut off Russian communications at a crucial part of the conversation.",
    "It is about IW from the scientific aspect,in academic way.However,I want to touch this topic on another side.Today,almost all people use social media such as,WhatsApp,Instagram,Twitter and so on.Of course,most of them use it to post themselves,their business,works or to earn money via these platforms in different ways.But,unfortunately,some people choose to use the bad side of social platforms.For example,sometimes the journalists share wrong information.Actually,these cases are found about the famous people, but it is not true.It makes people to think wrongly about anybody or anything.It is only one example that I show.Iâ€™m sure the count of such examples are quite a lot.",
